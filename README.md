#####Built at the Sudo HackStetson Hackathon
##Inspiration
Our product was inspired by the idea that using modern technology, we should be able to make things simpler, faster, and easier. Drone Drop does exactly that, within the market of prescription pharmaceutical delivery.

##What it does
Drone Drop is a software and hardware platform that is designed to expedite prescription pick-up and drop-off using readily available off-the-shelf hardware and our own software ecosystem. Using a Python server, the drone is controlled autonomously based on the GPS location of the end-user and the client pharmacy. Once the UAV arrives at the user's destination, custom hardware drops a small lever on the drone and delivers the prescription medication.
